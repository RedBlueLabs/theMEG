1)-added button under L1
    frame.nubmer in {X,Y,Z}
        allows for multiple packets to be selected.
        security purpose is so that two or more individual packets can be compared.  Especially useful when elapsed time between packets
2) changed default View>Time Display format to
    - seconds since previous packet
    - seconds (also useful to bounce between this and milliseconds)
    - selected "display seconds with hours and minutes
        security purpose of these changes is to visually show quickly how much time has passed.  It quickly answers the question how long did an incident occur?

1) added L7//HTTP//all unprotected cookies
    for any sites that have a user connect to it but it isn't secured properly this filter will bring you right to the packet that 
    has the PHPSESSION ID created
2) L7//HTTP//TLS session.id
    in the same thought as the previous addition, for secured sites a TLS session is created.  This will
    retrieve all packets involving session.id
    can be used to confirm user accessed a site, and what site it was
2.5) this is a old note but I actually changed the colour to bright yellow with black text so that when 
    when this traffic occurrs it really "pops"
